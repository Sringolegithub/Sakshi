    <p class="wrapper">All the content above the fold line on a long scrolling page will fit vertically within a browser window. Everything below that line will be seen when your visitor scrolls.

The exception to this rule is when the fold line is shorter than the devices actual height. In this case, Ceros will stretch to the width of the device and will scale the height proportionately.
